description = "The [comp]Sequence[/comp] is one of the core composite tasks. It executes its child tasks sequentially, from first to last, until one of them returns [FAILURE], or all of them result in [SUCCESS]. In other words, if any child task results in [FAILURE], the Sequence execution will be aborted, and the Sequence itself will return [FAILURE].

In our example, you can observe a simple [comp]Sequence[/comp] in action. Notice how it fails when it reaches the [act]Fail[/act] action and never proceeds to the [act]Wait 888 sec[/act] action afterward. By the way, the simple [act]Fail[/act] task is quite useful for troubleshooting. Its sole function is to return [FAILURE].
