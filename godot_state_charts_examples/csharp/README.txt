This example requires the .NET version of Godot to work. It will not work with the 
standard version of Godot. You can download the .NET version of Godot from 
https://godotengine.org/download. Note that the Steam version of Godot is the 
standard version and will not work with this example.

If you just freshly imported this into Godot and have not yet added other C# files 
to the project, you will need to initialize the project for C# by going to 
Project -> Tools -> C# -> Create C# Solution. Otherwise the demo will not
work because its files have not been compiled.
