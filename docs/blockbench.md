# Blockbench
Blockbench could be a good alternative to Blender. I've only used it a few times to create assets but it seems like its a little quicker for simpler models.

### Important Things to Remember

1. Make sure you create a Generic Model, not a Minecraft model
2. The default scale in blockbench is 16 units per meter
   1. This means its 16 bb units to 1 Blender or Godot unit
   2. This means its about 2.4 Trenchbroom units to BB unit
3.  When creating a texture, select the 32x pixel density, this is closest to the texel density we're using with the other applications
4.  When texture painting, remember we want a more noisey and realistic texture than a painterly or stylized one.
5.  Export to glTF and make sure you save your textures in the same folder
