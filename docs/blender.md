# Blender
## How to create a new model
- Open blender
- Install [this](https://github.com/noio/Pixel-Unwrapper) add-on. It's extremely helpful with the UV mapping step
- Create new project
- open File -> External Data -> check "Automaticall Pack Resources"
- Save .blender file in appropriate place in project directory
- Create the mesh
    - Going into the ins and outs of blender is beyond the scope of this document, but here are some general tips and guidelines
        - Your bread and butter are going to be the loop tool and manually moving verticies.
        - Try to evoke the idea of something rather than perfectly model its shape. We're aiming for low polygon counts.
            - For reference, the player model has just over 1000 faces total. This should be around the upper bound for characters.
        - The sculpt tools can be nice to even out more organic shapes

        - *APPLY TRANSFORMS*

- UV Mapping
    - This sucks, is a pain in the butt, and takes forever
    - First mark edges as seams.

    - Create grid texture
      - Open UV Editor
      - Click "+ New"
      - Name should be something like "nameofyouritem_t"
      - Set dimensions according to item's importance and size
        - Most items should probably be 64x64. 
        - Guns and larger items can go up to 128x128
        - Smaller pickups can go down to 32x32 or 32x64
      - Set generated type to UV or Color grid
      - Click Create Image and save
    - [unwrap using Pixel Unwrapper](https://github.com/noio/Pixel-Unwrapper?tab=readme-ov-file#unwrap-basic)
      - Make sure the texture pixels look square. If they don't its probably because you have an unapplied transform or something
- Texturing
